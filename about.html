            <h3>Private Events:</h3>

            <p>A professional photographer will take different shots of people
              at your event and print them right then and there so all guests
              will have the opportunity to  leave with a physical copy of the
              memory. We bring our own props and backdrop. </p>

              <p>
              Each guest receives a digital copy, or you can pre-buy physical
              copies for anyone to take home after the event. </p>

              <p>
              Make no mistake, this is no regular photobooth, but a group of
              experts that are ready to help ensure everyone has a great time.

            <h3>Setting up a Booth at a Restarant</h3>

            <p>We build oncoming clientelle through individualized physical and digital marketing.
              <br><br>
              <strong>How?</strong>
              <br><br>
              We offer a complimentary picture postcard to all your guests.
              This postcard has a wallet size photo of the guest and is surrounded by your company's photographs and promotions.
              <br><br>
              Guests will keep this and this at no cost to your business.
              <br><br>
              How our business will develop:
              <br><br>
              Guests have the option of purchasing a 4 by 6 FRAMED photograph of  the picture we took.
              <br><br>
              If they want to keep the memory they have the option to do so.
              <br><br>
              If not no problem!
              <br><br>
              We are happy for them to just keep the complimentary promotional postcard anyway!
