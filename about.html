          <h3>Private Events:</h3>

          <p>A professional photographer will take different shots of people
          at your event and print them right then and there so all guests
          will have the opportunity to  leave with a physical copy of the
          memory. We bring our own props and backdrop. <br><br>

          Each guest receives a digital copy, or you can pre-buy physical copies for anyone to take home after the event. <br><br>

          Make no mistake, this is no regular photobooth, but a group of experts that are ready to help ensure everyone has a great time.
