    For private events:
  </h3>
  <p>
    If you are an individual or company who is organizing an event and would like to have everyone attending to leave with a physical copy
    of a memory from the event, you are at the right place. Memory Captures can send a photographer with a backdrop and props for everyone
    that is attending to enjoy the event multiple times whenever they look at a picture. Make no mistake, this is no regular photobooth, but
    a group of experts that are ready to help ensure everyone has a great time.
