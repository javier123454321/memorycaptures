# THIS SITE IS DEPRECATED #

I started this project and it was my first real forray into making something useful into Web Development. I didn't know what I was doing, but I learned A LOT from this experience. I have since abandoned this version, and started a new version which handles actual business logic, and is therefore **private**. (I love open source, but it does not make sense for this app which is highly specific to the company). This repo is a historical artifact that I look at sometimes to see how far I have come. 

The current live version of the site written with Vue.js, and tied to a Laravel Backend:

### What I learned from this project: 
1. How to make a static site with HTML
1. How to style it globally with CSS
1. How to make async requests to APIs in JS
1. How to host a static site
1. How the basics of a webserver work
1. How much I love making things for the web
1. How the event loop in JS works
1. How to ask the right question to solve a problem
1. How to structure a project
1. How to use git and github
1. How persisting through a difficult problem and finding a solution is incredibly rewarding.

## About MemoryCaptures.

The company model is simple, we take photographs of people, whether at an event or at a restaurant, then give them the option to buy the picture. This framed photograph includes a digital copy which they can claim online.

  How it works to claim a photograph, when a customer gets a picture taken:

  We give them a code that they can input in the claim page of the website and their personal photograph will appear to them. (the code in this case was literally the filename)
