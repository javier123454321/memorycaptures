# THIS SITE IS DEPRECATED #

I started this project and it was my first real forray into making something useful into Web Development. I didn't know what I was doing, but I learned A LOT from this experience. I have since abandoned this version, and started a new version which you can see here. This repo is a historical artifact that I look at sometimes to see how far I have come.

What I learned from this project: 
1. How to make a static site with HTML
1. How to style it globally with CSS
1. How to make async requests to APIs in JS
1. How to host a static site
1. How the basics of a webserver work
1. How much I love making things for the web.

The current version of the site written with Vue.js, and tied to a Laravel Backend is here:
http://memorycaptures.com


Includes a basic landing page, an about me, and a page to claim a photograph.

The company model is simple, we take photographs of people, whether at an event or at a restaurant, then give them the option to buy the picture. This framed photograph includes a digital copy which they can claim online.

How it works to claim a photograph, when a customer gets a picture taken:

We give them a code that they can input in the claim page of the website and their personal photograph will appear to them. 

Questions about the company, contact info@memorycaptures.com

Created from scratch using old school html, css, and javascript, with a tiny bit of php for some of the functionality.

Used as my first real 'live' project. Chose to stay away from frameworks mostly to get some practice with the fundamentals of web development before moving on to newer trends.
