A website for my company Memory Captures
http://memorycaptures.com


Includes a basic landing page, an about me, and a page to claim a photograph.

The company model is simple, we take photographs of people, whether at an event or at a restaurant, then give them the option to buy the picture. This framed photograph includes a digital copy which they can claim online.

How it works to claim a photograph, when a customer gets a picture taken:

We give them a code that they can input in the claim page of the website and their personal photograph will appear to them. 

Questions about the company, contact info@memorycaptures.com

Created from scratch using old school html, css, and javascript, with a tiny bit of php for some of the functionality.

Used as my first real 'live' project. Chose to stay away from frameworks mostly to get some practice with the fundamentals of web development before moving on to newer trends.

Questions about anything related to the development, contact javier.e.glz@gmail.com
